# California-Housing-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical housing data, demonstrating data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling.

Key Features

Loads and preprocesses the California housing dataset.

Implements regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to predict housing prices.

Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.

Visualizes correlations, feature importance, and predicted vs. actual prices for better insights.

Tech Stack

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Use Cases

Predict housing prices based on property and location features.

Gain hands-on experience with regression modeling and evaluation metrics.

Can be extended to build real estate recommendation or pricing systems.
